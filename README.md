## Development
IF you want me to continue improving TheRat, THEN send me an e-mail that you are using TheRat.
 It might be useful to include your use case scenario for TheRat and a description of how it helps the ROI of the business you are involved in working.
 After all is said and done, information technology is there to support the business goals. 
 And the translation of business goals to automation with information technology is our job.


# TheRat (The Repository Archive Tool) Exposed
This makes puplic some of the components necessary to interface TheRat to other tools. 

The [**WIKI**](https://github.com/RobertArtigas/TheRatExposed/wiki) for this repository has a **TheRat** structure proposed definition. Theory is different from reality.

**Let us, then, look carefully into the matter. <br/>
It is likely that some troubles will befall us; but it is not a present fact. <br/> 
How often has the unexpected happened! How often has the expected never come to pass! <br/>
And even though it is ordained to be, what does it avail to run out to meet your suffering? <br/>
You will suffer soon enough, when it arrives; so look forward meanwhile to better things** <br/>
_- Lucius Annaeus Seneca the Younger_
<br/><br/>
If you would have maintained a ledger, and had written down your fears and anxieties with the possible outcomes of it, 
you would have found out that, most of your fears and anxieties were nothing but exageration of a possible 
future events judged by you, that never came to fruition, and at the same time most of the things you expected 
to go your way, the way you believed would happen, never happened either.
<br/><br/>
But we never pay attention to it, and are always living the life based on future possible outcome, 
suffering the disease yet to make us sick, 
wielding the sword for the wrong battle and thereby overlooking whatâ€™s needs to be done right now, 
and ignoring things requiring our attention at this moment.
