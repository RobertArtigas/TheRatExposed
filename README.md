## Development
IF you want me to continue improving TheRat, THEN send me an e-mail that you are using TheRat.
 It might be useful to include your use case scenario for TheRat and a description of how it helps the ROI of the business you are involved in working.
 After all is said and done, information technology is there to support the business goals. 
 And the translation of business goals to automation with information technology is our job.
